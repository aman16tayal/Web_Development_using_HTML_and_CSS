📄 Project Description
This is a simple website project made using HTML. The website is based on the theme of Meghalaya, a beautiful state in Northeast India, also known as the "Abode of Clouds." The project highlights the rich culture, traditions, and natural beauty of Meghalaya. It includes sections on Festivals, Waterfalls, Traditional Food, Flowers, and Tribes 👣. Visitors can read about popular festivals like Shad Suk Mynsiem, Nongkrem Festival, and Behdeinkhlam Festival 🎉. It also features famous waterfalls such as Elephant Falls, Rainbow Falls, and Dainthlen Falls 💧, as well as traditional dishes like Jadoh, Doh-Khlieh, and Pukhlein 🍽️.

To make the website more interactive and engaging, it uses the HTML <audio> tag to include tribal songs 🎵 and the <video> tag to show cultural performances and festivals 🎥. This allows users to listen to real music and watch traditional dances and rituals directly from the website. The entire project is built using only HTML, making it simple and easy to understand. It is a great learning project for beginners and also helps promote the culture and beauty of Meghalaya.
